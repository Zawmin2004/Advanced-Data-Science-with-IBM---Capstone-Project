# Capstone project for IBM Advanced Data Science

This project intended to submit an assignment for IBM Advanced Data Science: Capstone Project.

I chose data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository for heart failure clinical records collected and published by Chicco & Jurman (2020).

This project demonstrates how we can apply Machine Learning and Deep Learning to our research and data mining.

I hope you can enjoy looking at my work.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub.
